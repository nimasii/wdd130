  <h2>Jacob Campbell</h2>
  <h2>"Jake"</h2>
  <p>This is my second semester here at BYU-I! I'm majoring in computer
    science so I'm excitied to take this class and learn more about
    html! I have some experience with it, but it can never hurt to learn more.</p>
  <p>Some things that I really enjoy doing are: golfing, listening to and playing music,
    and a lot of different kinds of arts and crafts. I recently got engaged and am getting
    married during this semester! I'm obviously super excited to be married and planning a
    wedding along with work and school is definitly going to keep me very busy!</p>
